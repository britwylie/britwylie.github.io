This website has a collection of miscellaneous academic projects and works-in-progress both as a portfolio and a personal journal to keep track of things that I have done and want to do.

### About

Hello! I am a rising senior in Mechanical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology in search of an internship or co-op for Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. I work in leadership teams in Blacker Hovse and the Caltech Rocketry Club (PARSEC). I am interested in fluid mechanics, propulsion methods, and spacecraft. I am passionate about contributing to the future of human spaceflight.

### Research, Work, Academics...

This summer I am developing algorithms to analyze SBLI establishment in hypersonic flow with the Caltech Hypersonics Group. I have previously interned at WET as a production and design engineer, and at JPL as a summer and year-round intern working with early stage design and testing.

### Interests

In my spare time, I enjoy planning fun new projects, honing a new skill like forging or knifemaking, reading sci-fi, and hiking or canyoneering in Southern California.
